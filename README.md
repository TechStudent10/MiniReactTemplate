# React App Template
A template for React without using `create-react-app`.

## Why tho?
Before, I would use `create-react-app` for bootstrapping React applications. However, I've been experiencing problems with it. So, I decided to make this. A template for React without using `create-react-app`. You can figure out how to use it below.

## How to setup
First, use the template. You can do this by pressing the big "Use this template" button. Enter your details and create the app.

After that, you can modify components or whatever!

## How to run
I mean, you kinda have to run the app **AT LEAST** 10 times.

1. Open a terminal
2. Run `yarn install`. If you don't have Yarn installed, run `npm install yarn` then `yarn install`.
3. Run `yarn start`. This will start the web server.
4. Open `index.html` once it's finished compiling.

I do recommend, however, using VSCode with the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). This enables live reload and it's wayyyyy more convenient.
